--------------------
The code has been written entirely by us. 

Instruction to run :- Just run make command after doing cd to that folder.

Code
explanation:- Code needs size of packet as input and it outputs various
efficiency for time processing ranging from 1 to (size of packet +9) 9
because of transfer overhead. Code simulates working of processor. Each
lane takes certain amount of time to write a word due to different lane
size and lane speed.At a time, processor works only on one lane. The
code schedules when lane has completely written a word and when
processor finishes writing it in memory it notes the time delay. That
lane has to be idle for that amount of time. Now, it might happen that
there are no words to write if processing is done too fast.The code also
takes note for how much time processor-memory link is idle. This
simulation is run for 100000 seconds to get a good good idea about
efficiency.
Code outputs:- time processing, lane efficiency, processor-link efficiency
